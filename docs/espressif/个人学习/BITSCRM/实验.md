uint8_t的数据类型高低位互换
```shell
# Example bitscrambler program. Reads in 8 bytes and outputs 8 bytes where
# each byte's high and low nibbles (4 bits) are swapped. Specifically,
# for each input byte of the form 'abcdefgh' the output byte is 'efghabcd'.

                                 # need to process the 64 bits in M0/M1
